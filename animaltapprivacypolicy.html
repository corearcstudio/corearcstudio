        <h1>Privacy Policy for Tap the Animal</h1>
        <p class="date">Last Updated: October 26, 2023</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>We believe that privacy is a fundamental human right. <strong>Tap the Animal</strong> ("the App") is designed to be a safe, educational, and fun environment for users of all ages, especially children. We do not collect, store, or share any personally identifiable information (PII).</p>

        <h2>2. Data Collection</h2>
        <p>We do <strong>not</strong> collect any personal information from our users.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>No Accounts:</strong> You do not need to create an account or login to use the App.</li>
            <li><strong>No Analytics:</strong> We do not use third-party analytics services to track user behavior.</li>
            <li><strong>No Location Data:</strong> We do not request or access your geographic location.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Local Data Storage</h2>
        <p>All game progress is stored locally on your device:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Game Data:</strong> Your high scores, accumulated stars, unlocked animals, and shop items are saved directly to your device's storage (UserDefaults on iOS / localStorage on Web).</li>
            <li><strong>Settings:</strong> Your preferences for sound and haptic feedback are stored locally.</li>
            <li><strong>Deletion:</strong> If you delete the App from your device or clear your browser cache, this data is permanently removed. We cannot restore it because we do not have a copy.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. In-App Purchases</h2>
        <p>The App offers a "Premium Upgrade" via In-App Purchase (IAP).</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Payment Processing:</strong> All financial transactions are handled exclusively by Apple (via the App Store) or the respective platform provider.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Access:</strong> We never see, collect, or store your credit card information, billing address, or transaction history. We only receive a "receipt" from the App Store indicating whether the purchase was successful so we can unlock the features.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Children’s Privacy (COPPA & GDPR-K Compliance)</h2>
        <p>The App is designed for children and families.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> collect personal information from children under 13.</li>
            <li>We do <strong>not</strong> include third-party advertising.</li>
            <li><strong>Parental Gate:</strong> Access to In-App Purchases or external links (if any) is protected by a "Parental Gate" (a math challenge) to ensure that a parent or guardian is supervising the action.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. External Resources</h2>
        <p>The App may download animal images from a secure content delivery network (CDN) to function. These requests do not transmit personal user data.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>8. Contact Us</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, please contact us through the app support page.</p>
